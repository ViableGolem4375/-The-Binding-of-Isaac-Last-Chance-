- Fix some visuals.
- Fix d4 effects on tainted character maybe?
- Forgotten essence effect is kind of a placeholder, need something more interesting.
- Sack of lucky pennies might be bugged.
- Maybe fix the issue with omega tech where it activates both both J+E if they both have it.
- Check if kindness/lilith essence charm story bosses.
- Essence items can give copies, maybe fix that or make sure they all stack.
- Need to test reloading game w/ items
- Maybe add some sound effects to items.
- The fix for respawning essence collectors isnt very elegant, maybe improve this. Maybe deal damage to it?
- Should have unique synergies for pontius/T pontius/proto tech. list of items to make synergies for:

 - Choco milk: works alongside spears on pontius, works alongside sword on T pontius, works alongside proto tech
 - Mom's knife: works alongside spears on pontius, works alongside sword on T pontius, works alongside proto tech
 - Tech 2: works alongside spears on pontius, works alongside sword on T pontius, works alongside proto tech
 - Ludovico: works alongside spears on pontius, works alongside sword on t pontius, works alongside proto tech
 - Incubus and twisted pair maybe: both fire normal tears as pontius, both fire normal tears as t pontius, both fire normal tears with proto tech
 - Tech X: works alongside spears as pontius, works alongside sword as t pontius, works alongside proto tech
 - Spirit sword: does not work on pontius, does not work on T pontius, does not work with spirit sword
 - C section: works alongside spears as pontius, works alongside sword as t pontius, works alongside proto tech
 - Proto tech (for pontius'): works alongside spears as pontius, works alongside sword as t pontius, hud needs to be repositioned, no stacking effect

local spearDamage = 10
                if laser and player:HasCollectible(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_20_20) then
                    spearDamage = spearDamage * 2
                end
                if laser and player:HasCollectible(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_INNER_EYE) then
                    spearDamage = spearDamage * 3
                end
                if laser and player:HasCollectible(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_MUTANT_SPIDER) then
                    spearDamage = spearDamage * 4
                end
                if laser and player:HasCollectible(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_EYE_SORE) then
                    spearDamage = spearDamage * math.random(1, 3)
                end
                if laser and player:HasPlayerForm(PlayerForm.PLAYERFORM_BABY) then
                    spearDamage = spearDamage * 2
                end
if player:HasCollectible(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_DR_FETUS) or player:HasCollectible(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_EPIC_FETUS) then
                    laser.TearFlags = TearFlags.TEAR_EXPLOSIVE | player.TearFlags
                end

if laser and player:HasCollectible(CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_TECHNOLOGY) then
                    laser.CollisionDamage = (playerDamage * spearDamage) + 1
                end
Here's this code bc its always necessary:
for i = 0, Game():GetNumPlayers() - 1 do
        local player = Game():GetPlayer(i)

if spear then
            local sprite = spear:GetSprite()
            sprite:Load("gfx/pontius_spear_throw.anm2", true) -- Load your custom animation
            sprite:Play("LargeRedLaser", true) -- Ensure correct animation plays
        end
